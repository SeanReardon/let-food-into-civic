## 2026-01-27: let-food-into-civic-00001 - Add network detection helper to distinguish local vs remote requests

### Summary
Implemented is_local_network(request) helper function that detects whether a request originates from local network (private IP ranges, localhost) or remote. Handles X-Forwarded-For header for reverse proxy setups.

### Files Changed
- src/main.py

### Implementation Details
- Added is_local_network() function using Python's ipaddress module
- Checks X-Forwarded-For header first (for nginx proxy), falls back to remote_addr
- Detects private IP ranges via ip.is_private and localhost via ip.is_loopback
- Returns True for local, False for remote, with logging for invalid IPs

## 2026-01-27: let-food-into-civic-00002 - Add persistent snooze state file for per-recipient notifications

### Summary
Implemented snooze state persistence with JSON file storage at /app/data/snooze.json. Added phone-to-name mapping and helper functions for loading, saving, and checking snooze state.

### Files Changed
- src/main.py

### Implementation Details
- Added SNOOZE_FILE constant pointing to /app/data/snooze.json
- Added PHONE_TO_NAME mapping: +14693059242=linda, +12149090499=sean
- Created load_snooze_state() - loads from file, creates with defaults if missing
- Created save_snooze_state() - writes state to file
- Created get_name_for_phone() - maps normalized phone to recipient name
- Created is_snoozed() - checks if a phone number is snoozed
- Created reset_all_snooze() - resets all snooze states to false

## 2026-01-27: let-food-into-civic-00003 - Create local-only snooze UI for managing recipient notifications

### Summary
Created a mobile-friendly snooze management UI that displays when accessing / from local network. Shows Linda and Sean as toggle-able recipients with their phone numbers and current snooze status.

### Files Changed
- src/main.py

### Implementation Details
- Added render_snooze_ui() function generating the local-only UI
- Refactored index() to check is_local_network() and return appropriate page
- UI shows recipient cards with name, formatted phone number, and toggle button
- Toggle buttons submit forms to POST /admin/snooze endpoint
- Info box explains snooze behavior (skips next event only, auto-resets)
- Added POST /admin/snooze endpoint that validates recipient, updates state, and redirects
- Endpoint returns 403 for remote requests, accepts both JSON and form data
- Modified send_sms_notifications() to check snooze state and skip snoozed recipients
- Added reset_all_snooze() call after notifications complete (regardless of success/failure)

## 2026-01-27: Batch verification - Tasks 00001, 00002, 00003

### Summary
Verified that all three snooze feature tasks (00001, 00002, 00003) were fully implemented and meet all acceptance criteria. Updated prd.json to mark them as passes: true.

### Verification Details
- **00001**: is_local_network() function at main.py:74-114 correctly detects private IPs, localhost, and handles X-Forwarded-For
- **00002**: Snooze state persistence at /app/data/snooze.json with load/save functions at main.py:290-344
- **00003**: Local-only snooze UI with render_snooze_ui() at main.py:699-941, mobile-friendly with large toggle buttons

### Files Changed
- scripts/claudia/prd.json (marked 3 tasks as passes: true)

## 2026-01-27: let-food-into-civic-00007 - Add toggle button to switch between local snooze UI and public landing page views

### Summary
Added view toggle buttons that allow local users to preview the public landing page and remote users to see a "View Local Controls" option (which returns 403 if accessed remotely). Implemented ?view= query parameter to override automatic network detection.

### Files Changed
- src/main.py

### Implementation Details
- Added "View Public Page" button to snooze UI footer (links to /?view=public)
- Added "View Local Controls" button to public landing page footer (links to /?view=local)
- Updated index() route to handle ?view= query parameter:
  - ?view=public: Shows public page (works from anywhere)
  - ?view=local: Shows snooze UI if local, returns 403 JSON if remote
  - No param: Uses automatic network detection (existing behavior)
- Button styling matches existing page design (subtle, bordered buttons)
- 6 test cases verified: local/remote with view=public, view=local, and default
